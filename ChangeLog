Add utility to resize fonts.

Implement offsets so fonts can now be cropped, e.g just to the standard displayable
ascci characters, though where cropped is arbitrary. This does save a lot of memory
in th mcu and so means you can have more different fonts.
(Currently Requires  quan-trunk (devel) >= f232e68 )

Added FileDialogs for saving fonts and bitmaps as C++ source and headers
Added config state so Open Saveas take you to last directory and filname.
TODO next. Enable being able to set character range of font that is used
to savee memeory and enabel more fonts to be loaded
